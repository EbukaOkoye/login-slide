## Description


This is a project i did with @Chukwu Blessed on linkedIn. We were inspired by a design we saw while surfing the net. We saw a beautiful login form design and decided to add some animation. We used Html, CSS and Vanilla javascript to achieve the animation on the login and sign-up form. The project is a desktop view only project and was not made for phone view. One major challenge was in achieving the animation in javascript as we had to calculate the width and the movement of the elements we targeted to achieve out target goal.
